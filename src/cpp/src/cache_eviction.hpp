/**
 * @brief Determines blocks to be evicted from the KV cache of a sequence based on the importance score calculated from the
 * attention scores of each token at each attention layer in the LLM.
 *
 * The KV cache is conceptually divided into three areas as shown below:
 *
 * ```
 * --> *logical KV cache space in blocks*
 * | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
 * |<- start area->|<-   evictable area    ->|<- recent area ->|
 * ```
 *
 * The sizes of each areas are configurable. Once the sequence KV cache utilization is such that all three areas
 * are filled, the algorithm determines the blocks from the *evictable area* that should be freed from this sequence
 * based on the importance scores accumulated after each previous generation step in the pipeline. The least important
 * tokens according to this score are to be evicted. Only the tokens from the *evictable area* are evicted - the tokens
 * in the *start* and *recent* areas are never evicted, but throughout the eviction process the *recent* blocks naturally
 * move into the *evictable* area.
 *
 * Eviction only starts when at least one block *past* the *recent area* is completely filled, and the corresponding number
 * of blocks is selected to be evicted, so that the remaining blocks completely fit into the arena defined by the *start*,
 * *evictable* and *recent* areas. This effectively caps the cache usage for the sequence by the size of the arena (plus,
 * in general, one partially filled block past the recent area).
 *
 * Sizes of *start*, *evictable* and *recent* areas are configurable, but the *evictable* area size specifies the
 * _minimal_ size of the evictable area. When tokens overflow the eviction arena, the actual evictable area is
 * determined as the tokens between the fixed-size *start area* and the fixed-size *end area*, so at a given eviction step
 * there are in general more tokens considered for eviction than the specified *evictable* size.
 *

/**
 * @brief Computes, based on the logical indices of the blocks to be evicted, the rotation coefficients for the
 * remaining cache blocks.
 *
 * The rotation assumes that the executed model applies rotary positional embedding (RoPE) during the execution of
 * the attention operation. Each cache block therefore has the RoPE values already "baked in", with positions equivalent
 * to the point in time when the cache block values were originally computed in one of the previous attention
 * operations. When blocks are evicted, the logical index space of the remaining blocks is in general no longer
 * contiguous with respect to the effective positions of tokens in the blocks. Cache rotation allows to remedy this by
 * effectively adjusting the RoPE positions of certain blocks in the cache after eviction, by additionally "rotating"
 * them (in the same sense as in RoPE) by such angles that the cache blocks in the logical index space are again
 * contiguous in terms of the RoPE positions. This is supposed to make the eviction process less impactful on the
 * accuracy of the generation.
 *
 * Currently only the basic RoPE method is supported (as applied in the Llama original models). Each model in general
 * may have its own RoPE method (e.g. non-linear/NTK frequency scaling), and ideally the cache rotation calculator
 * should be adjusted based on the specifics of the RoPE defined by the LLM.
