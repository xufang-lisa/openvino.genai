# Introduction to OpenVINO GenAI

## What is OpenVINO GenAI?

OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ GenAI is a library of the most popular Generative AI model pipelines, optimized execution methods, and samples that run on top of highly performant [OpenVINO Runtime](https://docs.openvino.ai/).
It provides simplified APIs for running generative models, hiding the complexity of the generation process and enabling developers to easily integrate state-of-the-art generative models into their applications with minimal code.

As a lightweight solution designed for efficient inference, OpenVINO GenAI includes all the core functionality needed for generative model execution (e.g. tokenization via `openvino-tokenizers`) with no external dependencies required.
This library is friendly to PC and laptop execution, and optimized for resource consumption.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **üì¶ Pre-built Generative AI Pipelines:** Ready-to-use pipelines for text generation (LLMs), image generation (Diffuser-based), speech processing (Whisper), and visual language models (VLMs). See all [supported use cases](/docs/category/use-cases).
- **üë£ Minimal Footprint:** Smaller binary size and reduced memory footprint compared to other frameworks.
- **üöÄ Performance Optimization:** Hardware-specific optimizations for CPU, GPU, and NPU devices.
- **üë®‚Äçüíª Programming Language Support:** Comprehensive APIs in both Python and C++.
- **üóúÔ∏è Model Compression:** Support for 8-bit and 4-bit weight compression, including embedding layers.
- **üéì Advanced Inference Capabilities:** In-place KV-cache, dynamic quantization, speculative sampling, and more.
- **üé® Wide Model Compatibility:** Support for popular models including Llama, Mistral, Phi, Qwen, Stable Diffusion, Flux, Whisper, and others. Refer to the [Supported Models](/docs/supported-models) for more details.

## Workflow Overview

Using OpenVINO GenAI typically involves three main steps:

1. **Model Preparation:**
    - Download pre-converted model in OpenVINO IR format (e.g. from [OpenVINO Toolkit](https://huggingface.co/OpenVINO) organization on Hugging Face).
    - Convert model from other frameworks to the OpenVINO IR format (e.g. using `optimum-intel`), optionally applying weights compression.

    You can use models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/home)

    Refer to [Model Preparation](/docs/category/model-preparation) for more details.

    :::
2. **Pipeline Setup:** Initialize the appropriate pipeline for your task (`LLMPipeline`, `Text2ImagePipeline`, `WhisperPipeline`, `VLMPipeline`, etc.) with the converted model.
3. **Inference:** Run the model with your inputs using the pipeline's simple API.

## Comparison with Alternatives

Unlike base OpenVINO, which requires manual implementation of generation loops, tokenization, scheduling etc., OpenVINO GenAI provides these components in a ready-to-use package.

Compared to Hugging Face Optimum Intel, OpenVINO GenAI offers a smaller footprint, fewer dependencies, and better performance optimization options, particularly for C++ applications.

## System Requirements

OpenVINO GenAI is built on top of OpenVINO Runtime and shares the same system requirements.

Refer to the [OpenVINO System Requirements](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/about-openvino/release-notes-openvino/system-requirements.html) for more details.
